I would like to create a series of markdown documents that contains use case requirements for each feature of a simple but secure modern web application that will be used by the local residents and board members of the Wendover Homeowners Association in Bedford, Texas.  The web application will be built using an all-Microsoft technology stack complimented with Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons, and the Cosmo Bootswatch Theme that will be mobile first, responsive, have consistent UI styling, and an API layer between the application and database.  The web application will be and hosted on IONOS Web Hosting Business Windows plan.  Each use case requirements markdown document will be used by the Cascade AI Claude 3.7 Sonnet to build the application in an interactive fashion that will allow delivery of the application in phases, which will also require a markdown document with a checklist of tasks to be completed for each phase.  Let's make sure that each use case requirements markdown document is clear, concise, easy to understand, and specific to each individual feature to ensure the size of the file is not too large.
