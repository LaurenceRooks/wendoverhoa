# Security Setup for Wendover HOA

This document outlines the security setup for the Wendover HOA project, including GitHub security features, code scanning, and best practices.

## GitHub Security Features

### CodeQL Analysis

The project uses GitHub's default CodeQL setup for static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities. This is automatically configured through GitHub's repository settings and doesn't require any custom workflow files.

Benefits of using the default setup:

1. **Automatic Updates**: GitHub automatically keeps the CodeQL analysis engine updated with the latest security queries and fixes.

2. **Seamless Integration**: Results are directly integrated into GitHub's security tab and pull request checks.

3. **Optimized Performance**: The default setup is optimized for GitHub's infrastructure, resulting in faster analysis times.

4. **No Configuration Needed**: GitHub automatically detects the languages in your repository and applies the appropriate analysis.

The default CodeQL setup scans for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors
- Data flow problems
- Resource leaks
- API usage errors

We've configured our CodeQL setup in the GitHub repository settings under "Code security and analysis" to use the default configuration.

### Basic Security Checks

In addition to CodeQL, we perform basic security checks in our CI/CD pipeline:

- Scanning for potential hardcoded secrets
- Checking for common SQL injection patterns
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Dependency Scanning

We use GitHub's dependency scanning to detect vulnerable packages:

- Configured in `.github/workflows/dependency-scanning.yml`
- Runs on push to main, pull requests to main, and weekly schedule
- Checks both direct and transitive dependencies

### Secret Scanning

We use GitHub's secret scanning to prevent credential leaks:

- Configured in `.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml`
- Runs on push to main and pull requests to main
- Uses TruffleHog to detect potential secrets

## Application Security Measures

### Authentication and Authorization

- ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication
- JWT-based authentication for API access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Data Protection

- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy

### Secure Coding Practices

- Code reviews required for all changes
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency updates
- Following OWASP Top 10 guidelines

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to the repository**
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
   - Use environment variables for configuration

2. **Keep dependencies up to date**
   - Regularly update NuGet packages
   - Address security vulnerabilities promptly

3. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
   - Limit permissions to the minimum required
   - Use role-based access control

4. **Implement proper error handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security events appropriately

5. **Validate all inputs**
   - Validate input data on both client and server
   - Use parameterized queries for database access

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Wendover HOA project, please follow the guidelines in our [Security Policy](/.github/SECURITY.md).
