# GitHub Workflow Strategy

This document outlines our GitHub workflow strategy for the Wendover HOA project, including branch management, pull requests, and CI/CD pipeline optimization.

## Branch Strategy

We follow the GitHub Flow branching strategy:

1. **Main Branch**: The `main` branch is always deployable and represents the production-ready state of the codebase.
2. **Feature Branches**: All development work is done in feature branches created from `main`.
3. **Naming Convention**: Feature branches follow the naming convention:
   - `feature/feature-name` for new features
   - `fix/issue-name` for bug fixes
   - `docs/document-name` for documentation updates
   - `refactor/component-name` for code refactoring
   - `test/test-name` for adding or updating tests

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**: Always start by creating a feature branch from `main`.
2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in the feature branch.
3. **Create a Pull Request**: When your changes are ready, create a pull request to merge your feature branch into `main`.
4. **Code Review**: All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one team member.
5. **CI/CD Validation**: All automated checks must pass before merging.
6. **Merge**: Once approved and all checks pass, merge the pull request into `main`.

## Workflow Optimization

To avoid duplicate workflow runs and optimize our CI/CD pipeline, we've configured our GitHub Actions workflows as follows:

### Trigger Configuration

1. **Push to Main**:
   - Workflows run when changes are pushed to `main` (typically after a PR is merged).
   - This ensures that the final state of the code is validated after merging.

2. **Pull Requests**:
   - Workflows run on pull requests targeting `main`.
   - We've added `types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]` to specify exactly when the workflow should run.
   - We've added `paths-ignore` to skip workflow runs for documentation-only changes when appropriate.

3. **Documentation Changes**:
   - Documentation-specific workflows only run when documentation files are changed.
   - This prevents unnecessary builds for documentation-only changes.

### Workflow Efficiency

1. **Conditional Steps**:
   - We use `if` conditions to skip steps that aren't relevant to the current changes.
   - This reduces workflow execution time and resource usage.

2. **Continue on Error**:
   - Non-critical steps use `continue-on-error: true` to prevent workflow failures for minor issues.
   - This ensures that the workflow completes and provides feedback even if some steps fail.

3. **Caching**:
   - We use caching for dependencies to speed up workflow execution.
   - This reduces build times and resource usage.

4. **Security Scanning Integration**:
   - We rely entirely on GitHub's default CodeQL setup for security scanning.
   - We've removed custom CodeQL workflows to avoid conflicts.
   - This ensures seamless integration with GitHub's security features.

## Best Practices

1. **Always Create Pull Requests**:
   - Never push directly to `main`.
   - Always create a feature branch and pull request for changes.

2. **Semantic PR Titles**:
   - Use semantic commit messages for PR titles (e.g., `feat: Add user authentication`).
   - This helps with automated changelog generation and release management.

3. **Keep PRs Small**:
   - Break large changes into smaller, focused pull requests.
   - This makes review easier and reduces the risk of merge conflicts.

4. **Update Regularly**:
   - Keep feature branches up to date with `main` to avoid merge conflicts.
   - Rebase or merge from `main` regularly during development.

5. **Clean Up Branches**:
   - Delete feature branches after they're merged.
   - This keeps the repository clean and focused.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that our development process is efficient, reliable, and maintainable.
