## Interaction Patterns

### Navigation

#### Global Navigation

- Use consistent primary navigation across all pages
- Highlight current section to provide context
- Ensure navigation is keyboard accessible
- Collapse navigation on mobile devices with hamburger menu
- Provide breadcrumbs for deep navigation paths

```html
<!-- Example breadcrumb implementation -->
<nav aria-label="breadcrumb">
  <ol class="breadcrumb">
    <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="#">Documents</a></li>
    <li class="breadcrumb-item active" aria-current="page">HOA Bylaws</li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

#### Page Structure

- Use consistent page layouts with clear visual hierarchy
- Place primary actions prominently in the user's scanning path
- Group related information and actions together
- Provide clear section headings and subheadings
- Use white space effectively to separate content sections

### Forms and Data Entry

#### Form Design

- Group related fields logically
- Use single-column layouts for most forms
- Place labels above input fields for better readability
- Clearly indicate required fields with an asterisk (*)
- Provide helpful placeholder text and tooltips
- Use appropriate input types (date pickers, dropdowns, etc.)

```html
<!-- Example form field with accessibility considerations -->
<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="email" class="form-label">Email address <span class="text-danger">*</span></label>
  <input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" 
         aria-describedby="emailHelp" required>
  <div id="emailHelp" class="form-text">
    We'll never share your email with anyone else.
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Validation and Error Handling

- Provide real-time validation when possible
- Display clear error messages next to the relevant field
- Use color, icons, and text to indicate validation status
- Preserve user input when errors occur
- Provide constructive guidance on how to fix errors

```html
<!-- Example validation error -->
<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="password" class="form-label">Password <span class="text-danger">*</span></label>
  <input type="password" class="form-control is-invalid" id="password" required>
  <div class="invalid-feedback">
    Password must be at least 8 characters and include a number and special character.
  </div>
</div>
```

### Feedback and Notifications

#### System Feedback

- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Use toast notifications for non-critical information
- Use modal dialogs for important confirmations
- Display loading indicators for operations taking longer than 1 second
- Communicate success or failure of operations clearly

```html
<!-- Example toast notification -->
<div class="toast show" role="alert" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true">
  <div class="toast-header">
    <strong class="me-auto">Notification</strong>
    <small>Just now</small>
    <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="toast" aria-label="Close"></button>
  </div>
  <div class="toast-body">
    Your payment has been processed successfully.
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Confirmation Dialogs

- Use confirmation dialogs for destructive or irreversible actions
- Clearly state the consequences of the action
- Use clear and specific button labels (avoid generic "OK" and "Cancel")
- Allow keyboard navigation and focus management

```html
<!-- Example confirmation dialog -->
<div class="modal fade" id="deleteConfirmation" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="deleteConfirmationLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <h5 class="modal-title" id="deleteConfirmationLabel">Confirm Deletion</h5>
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        Are you sure you want to delete this document? This action cannot be undone.
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Keep Document</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Delete Permanently</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Data Visualization

### Tables

- Use tables for structured data comparison
- Allow sorting and filtering of table data
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Provide row highlighting on hover
- Ensure tables are responsive and accessible

```html
<!-- Example responsive table -->
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover">
    <caption>Payment History</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Date</th>
        <th scope="col">Description</th>
        <th scope="col">Amount</th>
        <th scope="col">Status</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <!-- Table rows -->
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

### Charts and Graphs

- Select appropriate chart types for the data being displayed
- Provide clear titles and labels
- Include legends when using multiple data series
- Ensure charts are accessible with alternative text descriptions
- Use consistent color schemes across all visualizations

```html
<!-- Example chart with accessibility considerations -->
<div class="chart-container" role="img" aria-label="Bar chart showing monthly expenses by category">
  <canvas id="expensesChart"></canvas>
</div>
```

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement logical tab order following visual layout
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Support keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Test navigation using keyboard only

### Screen Readers

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alternative text for images
- Use ARIA roles, states, and properties appropriately
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Implement skip links for navigation

```html
<!-- Example skip link -->
<a href="#main-content" class="visually-hidden-focusable">Skip to main content</a>

<!-- Later in the document -->
<main id="main-content">
  <!-- Main content -->
</main>
```

### Color and Contrast

- Ensure text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
- Do not rely on color alone to convey information
- Provide additional indicators (icons, text) alongside color
- Test designs in grayscale to verify information hierarchy
- Support high contrast mode

## Mobile and Responsive Design

### Touch Interactions

- Design touch targets with minimum size of 44x44 pixels
- Provide adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Implement touch-friendly controls (larger buttons, sliders)
- Consider thumb zones when placing important actions
- Test on actual mobile devices

### Responsive Layouts

- Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
- Use flexible grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Prioritize content and features for smaller screens
- Test designs at various breakpoints
- Ensure text remains readable without zooming

```html
<!-- Example responsive grid layout -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
      <!-- Primary content -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-4">
      <!-- Secondary content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Perceived Performance

- Implement progressive loading for content-heavy pages
- Use skeleton screens during content loading
- Prioritize above-the-fold content loading
- Provide visual feedback for ongoing processes
- Optimize transitions and animations for smoothness

```html
<!-- Example skeleton loader -->
<div class="card skeleton-loader">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title placeholder-glow">
      <span class="placeholder col-6"></span>
    </h5>
    <p class="card-text placeholder-glow">
      <span class="placeholder col-7"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-4"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-4"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-6"></span>
      <span class="placeholder col-8"></span>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Offline Support

- Implement service workers for core functionality
- Provide offline access to critical documents
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Display helpful offline messages
- Sync data when connection is restored

## Usability Testing

### Testing Methodology

- Conduct usability testing throughout the development process
- Test with representative users from each persona group
- Define specific tasks for testing sessions
- Measure task completion rates, time on task, and error rates
- Collect qualitative feedback through think-aloud protocols

### Testing Scenarios

1. **New User Registration**
   - Task: Create a new account and complete profile setup
   - Success Criteria: Account created and profile completed without assistance

2. **Dues Payment**
   - Task: Find current balance and make a payment
   - Success Criteria: Payment completed successfully within 2 minutes

3. **Document Access**
   - Task: Find and download the HOA bylaws document
   - Success Criteria: Document located and downloaded within 1 minute

4. **Maintenance Request**
   - Task: Submit a maintenance request with photo attachment
   - Success Criteria: Request submitted with all required information

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Library

- Implement a consistent component library based on the UI Style Guide
- Document component usage patterns and best practices
- Create reusable Razor components for common UX patterns
- Ensure components support all required states and variations

```csharp
// Example Blazor component with UX considerations
@* AlertMessage.razor *@
<div class="alert alert-@GetAlertClass()" role="alert">
    @if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Title))
    {
        <h4 class="alert-heading">@Title</h4>
    }
    <p>@Message</p>
    @if (Dismissible)
    {
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" aria-label="Close" @onclick="OnDismiss"></button>
    }
</div>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Title { get; set; }
    
    [Parameter]
    public string Message { get; set; }
    
    [Parameter]
    public AlertType Type { get; set; } = AlertType.Info;
    
    [Parameter]
    public bool Dismissible { get; set; }
    
    [Parameter]
    public EventCallback OnDismiss { get; set; }
    
    private string GetAlertClass() => Type switch
    {
        AlertType.Success => "success",
        AlertType.Warning => "warning",
        AlertType.Error => "danger",
        _ => "info"
    };
    
    public enum AlertType
    {
        Info,
        Success,
        Warning,
        Error
    }
}
```

### Accessibility Implementation

- Implement accessibility features from the beginning, not as an afterthought
- Use built-in HTML semantics whenever possible
- Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers regularly
- Validate against WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Document accessibility features and considerations
