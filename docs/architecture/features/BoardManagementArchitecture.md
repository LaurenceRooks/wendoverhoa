# Board Management Feature Architecture Guide

## Overview

This document provides architectural guidance for implementing the Board Management feature in the Wendover HOA application, mapping components to the Clean Architecture layers, CQRS/MediatR patterns, and identifying cross-cutting concerns. The Board Management feature provides tools for managing HOA board members, committees, roles, and responsibilities.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Logging

- Log committee member changes
- Log election configuration changes
- Log voting activities
- Log access to board portal

### Caching
- Cache board structure (medium duration)
- Cache committee listings (medium duration)
- Cache election information (short duration)
- Cache election results (longer duration)
- Cache board portal data (short duration)

### Exception Handling
- Handle board member not found
- Handle committee not found
- Handle election not found
- Handle unauthorized access
- Handle validation failures
- Handle voting errors

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access Control
- View board information: All authenticated users
- View detailed board member information: Based on privacy settings
- Manage board members: Board Members, Administrators
- Manage committees: Board Members, Administrators
- Configure elections: Administrators
- Vote in elections: Authenticated users based on eligibility

### Election Security
- Secure voting mechanism with vote verification
- Prevention of duplicate votes
- Audit trail for all election activities
- Secure storage of vote records
- Anonymous vote tallying

### Data Protection
- Protect personal information of board members
- Secure handling of election data
- Validate and sanitize all input
- Implement rate limiting for voting
