# Payment Processing Feature Architecture Guide

## Overview

This document provides architectural guidance for implementing the Payment Processing feature in the Wendover HOA application, mapping components to the Clean Architecture layers, CQRS/MediatR patterns, and identifying cross-cutting concerns. The Payment Processing feature enables secure, efficient methods for residents to make payments for HOA dues and fees, while giving administrators tools to manage and reconcile payments.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Logging
- Log payment processing attempts and results
- Log refund processing
- Log payment method additions and removals
- Log configuration changes
- Log reconciliation activities
- Log payment gateway interactions
- Log security-related events

### Caching
- Cache payment configuration (medium duration)
- Cache payment methods (short duration)
- Cache payment history summaries (short duration)
- Cache reconciliation data (short duration)
- Cache report data (short duration)

### Exception Handling
- Handle payment gateway errors
- Handle validation errors
- Handle reconciliation discrepancies
- Handle security violations
- Handle integration errors with other features

## Security Considerations

### PCI DSS Compliance
- Never store full credit card numbers
- Encrypt sensitive payment data
- Implement proper key management
- Restrict access to payment data
- Implement strong authentication for payment operations
- Maintain audit logs for all payment activities
- Regular security testing and vulnerability scanning

### Role-Based Access Control
- Make payments: Residents
- View own payment history: Residents
- Configure payment methods: Administrators
- Process refunds: Board Members, Administrators
- Reconcile payments: Board Members, Administrators
- Generate payment reports: Board Members, Administrators
- View all payment data: Administrators

### Fraud Prevention
- Implement transaction limits
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Validate billing addresses
- Implement velocity checks
- Use address verification service (AVS)
- Implement 3D Secure for credit card payments

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all payment communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all input parameters
- Implement CSRF protection for payment forms
- Apply appropriate security headers
