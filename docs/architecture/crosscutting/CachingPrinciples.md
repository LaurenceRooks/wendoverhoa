# Caching Principles

This document outlines the core caching principles for the Wendover HOA application, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to caching across all layers of the application in alignment with Clean Architecture principles.

## Core Principles

The Wendover HOA application follows these fundamental caching principles:

1. **Cache Consistency**: Ensure cached data remains consistent with the source of truth
2. **Performance Optimization**: Use caching to reduce database load and improve response times
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize memory usage and minimize cache overhead
4. **Appropriate Cache Duration**: Set cache expiration based on data volatility
5. **Security-First Approach**: Never cache sensitive information
6. **Clean Architecture Alignment**: Maintain separation of concerns in cache implementation

## Cache Types

The application utilizes multiple cache types based on specific needs:

| Cache Type | Use Case | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **In-Memory Cache** | Frequently accessed, relatively static data | User roles, configuration settings |
| **Distributed Cache** | Data that needs to be shared across instances | Session data, authentication tokens |
| **Response Cache** | Full HTTP responses for public, non-personalized content | Public announcements, community calendar |
| **Output Cache** | Rendered HTML fragments | Page headers, footers, navigation menus |
| **Data Cache** | Query results and domain objects | Property listings, resident directories |

## Caching Decision Framework

When determining what to cache, follow this decision framework:

1. **Is the data read-intensive?** Data that is read frequently but updated infrequently is ideal for caching
2. **Is the data computation-intensive?** Results of complex calculations should be cached
3. **Is the data shared across users?** Shared data is a good candidate for caching
4. **How volatile is the data?** Highly volatile data may not benefit from caching
5. **What is the impact of stale data?** Critical data requiring real-time accuracy may not be suitable for caching

## Cache Duration Guidelines

| Data Type | Volatility | Cache Duration | Example |
|-----------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Static Reference Data | Very Low | 24+ hours | States, ZIP codes |
| Configuration Settings | Low | 1-6 hours | Application settings |
| Aggregate Data | Medium | 15-60 minutes | Financial summaries |
| User-Specific Data | Medium-High | 5-15 minutes | User preferences |
| Real-Time Data | Very High | 0-60 seconds | Available payment methods |

## Cache Key Naming Conventions

Follow these naming conventions for cache keys to ensure consistency and avoid collisions:

```
{ApplicationName}:{EntityType}:{Identifier}:{AdditionalContext}
```

Examples:
- `WendoverHOA:Property:123` - Property with ID 123
- `WendoverHOA:Announcements:Active:Page1` - First page of active announcements
- `WendoverHOA:User:456:Permissions` - Permissions for user with ID 456

## Conclusion

These caching principles provide a foundation for implementing an effective caching strategy across the Wendover HOA application. By following these guidelines, the application will maintain a consistent, efficient, and secure approach to caching that aligns with Clean Architecture principles and optimizes application performance.
