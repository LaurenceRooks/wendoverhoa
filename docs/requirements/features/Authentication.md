# Authentication and User Management

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the authentication and user management feature of the Wendover HOA web application. This feature will provide secure access to the application with role-based permissions and comprehensive user account management.

## User Roles
1. **Guest** - Unauthenticated users with limited access
2. **Resident** - Authenticated homeowners with basic access
3. **Committee Member** - Residents with additional permissions for specific committees
4. **Board Member** - HOA board members with administrative access
5. **Administrator** - Full system access for managing all aspects of the application

## Use Cases

### UC-AUTH-01: User Registration
**Primary Actor:** Guest
**Description:** Allow new users to register for an account
**Preconditions:** User is not authenticated
**Postconditions:** User account is created and pending approval

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to the registration page
2. User enters required information:
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Email address
   - Password (meeting complexity requirements)
   - Property address (for verification)
3. System validates the property address against the HOA database
4. System creates a new user account with "Pending" status
5. System sends a verification email to the user
6. System notifies administrators of the pending registration
7. User receives confirmation of successful registration

**Alternative Flows:**
- If the property address cannot be verified, the system notifies the user and provides contact information for manual verification
- If the email is already registered, the system notifies the user and provides password recovery options

### UC-AUTH-02: User Login
**Primary Actor:** Registered User
**Description:** Allow registered users to log in to the application
**Preconditions:** User has a verified account
**Postconditions:** User is authenticated and granted appropriate access

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to the login page
2. User enters their email and password
3. System validates credentials
4. If MFA is enabled, system prompts for the second factor
5. System authenticates the user and redirects to the dashboard
6. System logs the successful login attempt

**Alternative Flows:**
- If credentials are invalid, the system displays an error message
- If account is locked, the system provides information on how to unlock it
- If user forgets password, they can initiate password recovery

### UC-AUTH-03: External Authentication
**Primary Actor:** Registered User
**Description:** Allow users to authenticate using external providers
**Preconditions:** User has a verified account
**Postconditions:** User is authenticated and granted appropriate access

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to the login page
2. User selects an external provider (Microsoft, Google, or Apple)
3. User is redirected to the provider's authentication page
4. User authenticates with the provider
5. Provider redirects back to the application with authentication token
6. System verifies the token and associates it with the user's account
7. System authenticates the user and redirects to the dashboard

**Alternative Flows:**
- If the external account is not linked to an existing user, prompt to link or create a new account
- If the token verification fails, display an error message

### UC-AUTH-04: Password Management
**Primary Actor:** Authenticated User
**Description:** Allow users to manage their password
**Preconditions:** User is authenticated
**Postconditions:** Password is updated or reset

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to account settings
2. User selects "Change Password"
3. User enters current password and new password (twice)
4. System validates the new password against complexity requirements
5. System updates the password and logs the user out
6. User receives confirmation email of password change

**Alternative Flows:**
- If current password is incorrect, display an error message
- If new password doesn't meet complexity requirements, provide specific feedback
- If user forgets current password, they can use the password recovery process

### UC-AUTH-05: Multi-Factor Authentication
**Primary Actor:** Authenticated User
**Description:** Allow users to enable and manage MFA
**Preconditions:** User is authenticated
**Postconditions:** MFA is enabled, disabled, or reconfigured

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to account security settings
2. User selects "Enable Multi-Factor Authentication"
3. System presents MFA options (authenticator app, SMS, email)
4. User selects preferred method and follows setup instructions
5. User verifies setup by completing an MFA challenge
6. System enables MFA for the account
7. User receives confirmation email of MFA enablement

**Alternative Flows:**
- If verification fails, allow user to retry or select a different method
- Allow user to generate and save backup codes for account recovery

### UC-AUTH-06: User Profile Management
**Primary Actor:** Authenticated User
**Description:** Allow users to manage their profile information
**Preconditions:** User is authenticated
**Postconditions:** Profile information is updated

**Main Flow:**
1. User navigates to profile settings
2. User updates profile information:
   - Contact information
   - Notification preferences
   - Profile picture
   - Display name
3. System validates and saves the changes
4. User receives confirmation of successful update

**Alternative Flows:**
- If validation fails, display specific error messages
- If email is changed, require verification of new email

### UC-AUTH-07: User Account Administration
**Primary Actor:** Administrator
**Description:** Allow administrators to manage user accounts
**Preconditions:** User is authenticated as Administrator
**Postconditions:** User accounts are managed as requested

**Main Flow:**
1. Administrator navigates to user management section
2. System displays list of users with filtering and search options
3. Administrator can:
   - Approve/reject pending registrations
   - Enable/disable accounts
   - Reset passwords
   - Assign/revoke roles
   - View account activity
4. System logs all administrative actions
5. System sends appropriate notifications to affected users

**Alternative Flows:**
- Provide batch operations for managing multiple accounts
- Allow delegation of specific administrative tasks to Board Members

## Technical Requirements

1. **Security**
   - Passwords must be stored using ASP.NET Core Identity's default hashing (PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256)
   - Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
   - Session timeout after period of inactivity
   - Secure password reset with time-limited tokens
   - HTTPS enforcement for all authentication operations
   - Pass security scanning using GitHub's free tools (CodeQL, dependency scanning, secret scanning)
   - **Password Complexity Requirements:**
     - Minimum length: 12 characters
     - Must contain at least one character from each of the following categories:
       - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
       - Lowercase letters (a-z)
       - Numbers (0-9)
       - Special characters (!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'",.<>/?)
     - Must not contain common patterns (e.g., 12345, qwerty, password)
     - Must not contain the user's name, email, or username
     - Must not match any of the user's previous 5 passwords
     - Must not match the user's current password
     - Must not contain more than 3 consecutive identical characters
     - Password strength must be measured and displayed to users during creation/change
     - Passwords must be changed at least once every 365 days

2. **Performance**
   - Authentication processes should complete within 2 seconds
   - User management interfaces should load within 1 second

3. **Compliance**
   - Maintain audit logs of all authentication and user management activities
   - Implement data retention policies in compliance with regulations
   - Provide data export functionality for user data

4. **Architecture**
   - Implement using Clean Architecture principles
   - Follow SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles
   - Use CQRS pattern with MediatR for authentication operations
   - Create comprehensive unit and integration tests

5. **Integration**
   - Integrate with ASP.NET Core Identity 9
   - Support for Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)
   - RESTful API endpoints for all authentication operations
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
   - Comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for all authentication flows

## UI/UX Requirements

1. **Login/Registration Forms**
   - Clean, simple interface with clear error messages
   - Password strength indicator
   - "Remember me" option
   - Prominent options for password recovery and registration
   - Password visibility toggle (show/hide) for all password fields

2. **User Profile**
