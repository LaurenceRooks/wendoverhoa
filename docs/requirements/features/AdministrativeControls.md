# Administrative Controls

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the administrative controls feature of the Wendover HOA web application. This feature provides system-wide administrative capabilities that cut across all other features, enabling administrators to manage global settings, perform data restoration, monitor system health, and execute other administrative functions for the Wendover Homeowners Association in Bedford, Texas.

## User Roles
1. **Guest** - No access to administrative controls
2. **Resident** - No access to administrative controls
3. **Committee Member** - No access to administrative controls
4. **Board Member** - Limited access to specific administrative reports and functions
5. **Administrator** - Full access to all administrative controls and functions
